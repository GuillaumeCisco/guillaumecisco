# Guillaume Cisco's interactive website

## Installation

This project use yarn and the experimental yarn workspaces for package.json splitting and convenience.

Please install the last version of yarn and run 
`yarn config set workspaces-experimental true`

Then run:
`yarn install`


For testing and developping on the projet with true hot module replacement, run
`yarn start`

For testing with prod config:
`yarn start:prod`

For testing in electron, run:
`yarn dev`

For packaging for electron:
```
yarn build:electron
yarn build-electron
yarn package-all
```

For building the production website and deploy it, run:
Before deploying, create a file deploy.js in the tools folder with your param
```
yarn build:main
yarn deploy
```

You can now stop the task on aws ECS, it will restart automatically, if you did not define an autoscaling policy.

Do no forget to invalidate the cache on your aws redis instance.
Connect with ssh to your ec2 instance, then connect to your redis instance as explain in elasticache documentation.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted.ConnectToCacheNode.html#GettingStarted.ConnectToCacheNode.Redis.NoEncrypt
Then run `flushall`. You should automatize this part.
More information in the cache part below.

## Test and Cover

For running the test suite:
`yarn test`

For displaying covering:
`yarn cover`


## Eslint

For displaying lint errors:
`yarn eslint`

## Cache

This project use a redis cache manager for the server routes. Allowing us not to rerender the same html production by route.
For deploying with amazon, please create a redis cluster by following this documentation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted.CreateCluster.html
Don't forget to create a isolated security group for opening port 6379 as described in the documentation.

### test
For testing your generated docker with your localhosted redis, update your `deploy.js` file and do not forget to comment the part that push to your registry, then:
```shell
$> redis-cli flushall && docker run -it -v /etc/letsencrypt/:/etc/letsencrypt/ --net="host" -p 8000:8000 docker_image_name:latest
```

You'll notice I also bind the let's encrypt folder, more information in the next part.

Then head to https://localhost:8001/

Do not forget to `redis-cli flushall` when testing multiple times.

Disable redis for testing this project in ssl with `-p 8001:8443`.

## Encryption files creation

For creating your own self signed certificates

https://blog.didierstevens.com/2008/12/30/howto-make-your-own-cert-with-openssl/
```shell
cd encryption
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 4096
openssl req -new -x509 -days 1826 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
openssl genrsa -out ia.key 4096
openssl req -new -key ia.key -out ia.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 730 -in ia.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out ia.crt
```


#### With let's encrypt

##### Dev mode

```shell
sudo certbot certonly --manual -d guillaumecisco.com -d www.guillaumecisco.com
```

Places the files in the folder `./well-known/acme-challenge` and build and deploy your website, then continue the process for validating the ownership of the website.
Then places the generated files to the `encryption` folder.

The certificates will only last for 90 days, so be sure to create a cronjob with the command
```shell
sudo certbot renew
```
for issuing new certificates and rebuild and deploy your docker app.

##### Ec2

You should run these commands on the server running the docker app i.e the EC2 instance
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-certbot-standalone-mode-to-retrieve-let-s-encrypt-ssl-certificates

https://medium.freecodecamp.org/going-https-on-amazon-ec2-ubuntu-14-04-with-lets-encrypt-certbot-on-nginx-696770649e76

Be sure you can access you ec2 instance with ssh, then
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html

on your ec2 instance, follow these steps:
```shell
$> yum install wget python27-virtualenv
$> wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
$> chmod a+x certbot-auto
```
Be careful, when running the next command, you will need to create two files before pressing for the third time `continue`, and build and deploy your docker app again. 
These two files need to be placed in `.well-known/acme-challenge` folder.
Make sure the security group of your ec2 instance has ports 80 and 443 opened.
```shell
$> ./certbot-auto certonly --manual -d guillaumecisco.com -d www.guillaumecisco.com
```

After having deployed your app with the new available files, press continue, files will be available now on your ec2 instance.

You now need to make these files accessible to your docker app by modifying its permissions.
```shell
$> sudo groupadd certaccess
$> whoami
ec2-user
$> sudo usermod -a -G certaccess ec2-user
$> sudo usermod -a -G certaccess root
$> sudo chown ec2-user.certaccess /etc/letsencrypt/
$> sudo chown ec2-user.certaccess /etc/letsencrypt/live
$> sudo chown ec2-user.certaccess /etc/letsencrypt/archive
```

Now you need to create a volume on your ECS configuration task `/etc/letsencrypt/:/etc/letsencrypt/`
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_data_volumes.html

Or run the docker run command like that:
```shell
$> docker run -it -v /etc/letsencrypt/:/etc/letsencrypt/ -p 8001:8443 984406419997.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/guillaumecisco:latest
```

Your site is now secured!

###### Renewing

For now, we need to do it manually as the docker instance is binded to port 80 and 443. Cerbot need these port to renew thecertificates.
So we need to stop the docker, launch the command and the docker instance will be automatically renewed thanks to our aws ecs policy.

```shell
docker stop `docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep ecs-guillaumecisco` && ./certbot-auto renew --standalone
```
 
TODO: create a cronjob for renewing certificate and `docker restart container_name`

Maybe better use webroot plugin

Tip: For getting container name : `docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep ecs-guillaumecisco`
